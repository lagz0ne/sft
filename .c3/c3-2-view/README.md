## Goal



## Responsibilities

<!-- What responsibilities does this container own to satisfy context constraints? -->
<!-- What would break in the system without this container? -->

<!--
Container is both a deployment/runtime boundary AND a responsibility allocator.
It owns a set of responsibilities derived from the context's abstract constraints,
and distributes them across its components.

WHY DOCUMENT:
- Enforce consistency (current and future work)
- Enforce quality (current and future work)
- Support auditing (verifiable, cross-referenceable)
- Be maintainable (worth the upkeep cost)

ANTI-GOALS:
- Over-documenting -> stale quickly, maintenance burden
- Text walls -> hard to review, hard to maintain
- Isolated content -> can't verify from multiple angles

PRINCIPLES:
- Diagrams over text. Always.
- Fewer meaningful sections > many shallow sections
- Add sections that elaborate the Goal - remove those that don't
- Cross-content integrity: same fact from different angles aids auditing

GUARDRAILS:
- Must have: Goal + Components table
- Prefer: 3-5 focused sections
- Each section must serve the Goal - if not, delete
- If a section grows large, consider: diagram? split? ref-*?

REF HYGIENE (container level = cross-component concerns):
- Cite refs that govern how components in this container interact
  (communication patterns, error propagation, shared data flow)
- Component-specific ref usage belongs in component docs, not here
- If a pattern only affects one component, document it there instead

Common sections (create whatever serves your Goal):
- Overview (diagram), Components, Complexity Assessment, Fulfillment, Linkages

## Complexity Assessment

**Level:** <!-- [trivial|simple|moderate|complex|critical] -->
**Why:** <!-- signals observed from code analysis -->

## Components

| ID | Name | Category | Status | Goal Contribution |
|----|------|----------|--------|-------------------|
<!-- Category: foundation (01-09) | feature (10+) -->
<!-- Foundation components (01-09): infrastructure choices that enable features -->
<!-- Feature components (10+): business capabilities built on foundations -->
<!-- Goal Contribution: How this component advances the container Goal -->

## Layer Constraints

This container operates within these boundaries:

**MUST:**
- Coordinate components within its boundary
- Define how context linkages are fulfilled internally
- Own its technology stack decisions

**MUST NOT:**
- Define system-wide policies (context responsibility)
- Implement business logic directly (component responsibility)
- Bypass refs for cross-cutting concerns
- Orchestrate other containers (context responsibility)
